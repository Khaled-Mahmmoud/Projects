Tic-tac-toe is a simple, two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The objective is to be the first to align three of your marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. If all spaces are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
